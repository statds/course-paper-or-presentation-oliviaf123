# Attempting to Create a Classical Decision Tree Model to Predict Heart Disease
Heart disease has been the leading cause of death globally for 20 years (Khan, Hashim, Mustafa, Baniyas, Al Suwaidi, AlKatheeri, Alblooshi, Almatrooshi, Alzaabi, Al Darmaki, et al., 2020). The extraordinary availability of patient data in combination with the potential for great impact derived from successful statistical models serves as motivation for data analysis and model creation. The goal of this paper is to create a classical decision tree model using the largest heart disease data set available to predict heart disease (??, Cit). A classical decision tree with all variables in the data set had an error rate of .4967, a second model where individuals with a serum cholesterol level of 0 mg/dl were removed had an error rate of .5201, and a third model where the variable chest pain type and ST Slope were removed provided an error rate of .4924. The results provided by this paper reconfirm that classical decision trees are not the best model making method for heart disease.
